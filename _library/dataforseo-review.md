Building AI search tools requires robust data pipelines. DataForSEO provides the comprehensive SERP data needed to train and feed agentic models.

### Why it matters
- **Real-time data**: Essential for RAG applications.
- **Structured output**: JSON responses make integration with LLMs seamless.
- **Volume**: Capable of handling enterprise-grade request volumes.

I've used their API for the "Competitor Analysis" tool and the results are consistently reliable.
