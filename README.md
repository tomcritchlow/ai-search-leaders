AI Search Leaders

## What it is

The AI Search Leaders community is a membership + intelligence community for search professionals navigating the shift from “blue links SEO” to AI-first search. The industry is going through the most dramatic change we’ve ever seen: there’s no playbooks, no case studies, new tools, new data and a constantly evolving landscape. Every single search professional needs to adapt or get left behind.
We don’t sell services (like an agency) or software (like a vendor). We sell clarity and capability.

North Star: “AI Search Leaders is the world’s leading community of practice for AI‑Search Operators - the people defining how search works in the model‑first era. We own the standards, the data, the workflows, and the talent pipeline for this emerging discipline. We are the professional home + intelligence layer for the future of search.”

## The problem we solve (why members join)

* Information Overload & Uncertainty: SEOs are inundated with AI news but lack a filter for what actually matters for enterprise strategy.
* The "Black Box" Problem: Traditional rank tracking doesn't work for LLMs. Professionals are flying blind regarding visibility and attribution.
* Skill Obsolescence: The technical and content skills that worked in 2020 are rapidly becoming obsolete. Teams need to reskill from "optimizing for spiders" to "optimizing for models."

## The solution (what members get)
A recurring subscription ($1,000/year standard) built on three pillars:
1) Strategic Upskilling (Curriculum)
2x / month video content from industry experts showing real data, case studies, workflows and guidance.
Modular education programming on topics like vibe coding, prompt tracking. Building bite size actionable insights to learn new skills and tools.
Peer groups to learn from what others are doing and what’s actually working
2) Bespoke Intelligence (Data)
Individual prompt tracking - Every member gets access to prompt tracking through AI Search Leaders bundled with their membership - every member has data and we are building a community of action, not just a passive feed
Quarterly State of AI Search reports usable for C-suite briefings synthesizing industry trends and presenting original research
3) The War Room (Community)
A real-time discussion group segmented by industry and seniority. Private, high signal,real talk. (safe because we’re non-vendors)
Bi-weekly office hours with Tom + Jeremy to troubleshoot real problems
Real work objects: templates, prompts, dashboards, measurement setups

## Why we win (the moat)
Operational credibility beats “AI guru” vibes.
Tom Critchlow: senior industry thought leader that understands SEO and executive presence. Previously scaled the SEO MBA to > 1000 SEO professions (>60% director level or above).
Jeremy Cabral: previously scaled Finder to > $100m in revenue. Deep expertise in managing operations, automating SEO programs and the latest AI trends.
Non-vendor advantage: No conflict of interest. No upsell. Aligned with member outcomes.


Thanks,

Tom & Jeremy
