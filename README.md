## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1.  Push this repository to GitHub.
2.  Go to the repository **Settings**.
3.  Navigate to the **Pages** section (usually under "Code and automation").
4.  Under **Build and deployment**, select **Source** as `Deploy from a branch`.
5.  Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and the `/ (root)` folder.
6.  Click **Save**.

Your site should be live at your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `username.github.io/repo-name`) shortly. You can then configure a custom domain in the same settings page.
