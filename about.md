The AI Search Lab is a private community for senior SEO professionals, agency owners, and in-house leads. We navigate the shift from traditional search engine optimization to **AI-driven visibility**.

## The Shift

Search is undergoing its biggest transformation in 20 years. The move from "ten blue links" to AI Overviews, Chat-based search, and vertical AI agents requires a completely new playbook.

## Our Philosophy

We believe in **high-signal, low-noise** intelligence. 

*   **Observation**: We monitor the SERPs daily for volatility and new patterns.
*   **Experimentation**: We test hypotheses in a controlled environment.
*   **Collaboration**: We share findings openly within the membership.

## The Team

**Tom Critchlow** - Strategy Lead. Strategic consultant for Google, NYT, and startups.
**Jeremy Cabral** - Operations Lead. Founder of Finder.com.
